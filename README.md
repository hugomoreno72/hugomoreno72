# 👋 Hi there! I'm Hugo

🎓 I’m currently enrolled in the **Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp at KeepCoding®**, an intensive and hands-on program that covers the end-to-end development of AI-based solutions. I am gaining strong skills in Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, LLMs, MLOps, SQL, and BigQuery, among others — all with a practical focus on solving real-world problems.

💡 I hold a **Chemical Engineering degree from the University of Seville** and I am passionate about languages, especially English, having achieved the Cambridge C1 certification.
